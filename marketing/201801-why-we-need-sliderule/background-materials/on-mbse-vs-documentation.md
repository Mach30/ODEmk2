# On MBSE vs documentation
The commentary in this folder leaves out the growing field of Model Based Systems Engineering and its effort to replace documentation of systems (hardware, software, etc) with models of the systems.  Models have huge advantages, not the least of which is they can be built to embody DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) in a way documentation will never be able to do. But, this is still an emerging field of study, only just now beginning to be applied in industry.  As attractive as MBSE is, the open source hardware movement cannot wait for MBSE to mature. We need complete project hosting now, so we need to accept the challenges of documentation for now, while ensuring our project hosting tools are forward compatible with hosting systems models.
