This is where the project's [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) will be documented.  The use cases (and later agile epics, tasks, and user stories) will be derived from these principles.  

Some of the first principles will be based on lessons learned from [Open Design Engine](https://opendesignengine.net/) while others will be based on examining the core set of needs various project portals based on Sliderule will require.
