# Libraries
This folder (and its sub-folders) contain links, comments, and examples relating to various libraries the ODE mk 2 development team is researching.  Create a new sub-folder for any major new field of research.

# Current Assumptions
The following assumptions are driving the team's research.
* ODE mk 2 will be developed in [Node.js]()
* ODE mk 2 will likely use pieces of the [3REE stack](http://blog.workshape.io/the-3ree-stack-react-redux-rethinkdb-express-js/), with current emphasis on using React.js for the UI development
* ODE mk 2 will likely use [git]() as the underlying datastore to provide the framework for fork/branch/merge capabities

# Links to Libraries/Packages
* [WebPack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/)
* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) - may be useful in implementing the timeline service
