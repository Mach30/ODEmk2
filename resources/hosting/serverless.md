# Servless Deployments
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_Framework), "The Serverless Framework is a free and open-source web framework written using Node.js. Serverless is the first framework for building applications exclusively on AWS Lambda, a serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of the Amazon Web Services. A Serverless app can simply be a couple of lambda functions to accomplish some tasks, or an entire back-end composed of hundreds of lambda functions. Serverless currently supports Node.js and Python runtimes. Support for Java and other runtimes for AWS Lambda will be coming soon. Serverless is developed by Austen Collins and maintained by a dedicated, full-time team."

@m30_jrs is interested in researching this technology to see if any aspects of it make sense for a service like ODE.
